1:- Create React Project -Done
2:- Create three pages (Must handle with the routing library)
Home About Head & Tail -Done
3:- On the Home page, there should be two links for the About page and the Head & Tail page. -Done
4:- On the About page there will be a simple paragraph -Done
5:- In Head & Tail page you need to add one dropdown & one submit button.
- Here you need to implement a logic for head & tail.
- First of all, you need to add two values in the dropdown ‘ H ‘ & ‘ T ‘ 
and by default, there will be the text “select value” as a placeholder (if you haven’t selected anything).
- Select any value from the dropdown (H or T) and click on submit button. Now suppose you choose the H value and it should be visible below submit button, And now if you add two more times H then those 2 H chars should be visible below the first H (Below is the example)
H ← first added H
H ← second added H
H ← third added H
- Now If you select T then It should be visible beside First H, and if you again add T
then it should be visible below the first T (Below is an example) HT
HT
H
- Now if you add H then it should be visible beside the first T, and If you again add T
then It should visible beside H (Below is an example) HTHT
HT
H
- now at last if you again add T then it should be visible below the first T HTHT
HTT
H
All you need to do is make separate columns for H and T, if you add same char then it will visible below that added char, if you add a new then we’ll create a new column.
6:- Put a validation in submit button , if you have not selected H or T then there should be one validation message like “Please select value from dropdown”.
7:- Once you select any value from dropdown and click on submit button, the dropdown should reset to default value (which is “select value”).
